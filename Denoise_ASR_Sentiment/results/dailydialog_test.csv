344,My goodness ! Are you OK ?,6,6
345,"I broke my leg , but it is healing .",4,4
346,How long will you be out of class ?,4,4
347,I should be able to return by next Monday .,4,4
348,"Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon .",4,4
349,Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ?,4,4
350,"Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !",4,4
351,"I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .",4,4
352,"Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .",4,4
353,"Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .",4,4
354,That would be great ! Is it expensive ?,3,3
355,Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .,4,4
356,"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .",4,4
357,I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?,3,3
358,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .,4,4
359,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?,5,5
360,"Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",4,4
361,You need a babysitter .,4,4
362,"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .",4,4
363,I could have Suzy stay at my place .,4,4
364,"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",4,4
365,Why not ?,4,4
366,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,4,4
367,"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",4,4
368,"I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",4,4
369,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,4,4
370,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .,3,3
371,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .,4,4
372,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .,3,3
373,Good evening . What'll you have ?,4,4
374,I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ?,4,4
375,Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?,4,4
376,A draft beer please .,4,4
377,OK . Here you are .,4,4
378,Could I have some fruit ?,4,4
379,"Of course . Wait for a moment , please .",3,3
380,"Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?",4,4
381,"Fine , thank you , and how are you ?",4,4
382,"Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .",3,3
383,"Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .",3,3
384,How are you getting along with your business ?,4,4
385,"Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .",4,4
386,"I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .",3,4
387,"By the way miss , where is the toilet ?",4,4
388,"Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .",4,5
389,"What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .",6,6
390,You are welcome .,4,3
391,"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?",4,4
392,"you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .",4,4
393,that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?,4,4
394,"it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .",4,4
395,can I buy stamps here ?,4,4
396,sure . How many would you like ?,4,4
397,I need 30 for my Christmas cards .,4,4
398,are you sending them abroad ?,4,4
399,twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .,4,4
400,"do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .",4,4
401,no .,4,4
402,"ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .",4,4
403,and the bubble wrap ?,4,4
404,that ’ s another quid .,4,4
405,thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful .,3,3
406,"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?",4,3
407,I am cooking now !,3,4
408,Are you good at cooking ?,4,4
409,"I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !",4,4
410,It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !,3,4
411,I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?,4,4
412,"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .",4,4
413,That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .,4,4
414,I have the same idea as yours .,4,4
415,It's OK . Please have a taste of it .,4,4
416,"Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .",3,3
417,Thank you for your praise .,3,3
418,"Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?",4,4
419,"I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .",4,4
420,"So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?",3,4
421,Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .,3,4
422,Thanks a lot .,3,3
423,It's my pleasure .,3,3
424,Room service.What can I do for you ?,4,4
425,This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .,4,0
426,"Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?",4,4
427,"Yes , I ordered the express service .",4,4
428,"Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?",4,4
429,That's fine .,4,4
430,I'd like you to do me a favor .,4,4
431,What is it ?,4,4
432,Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .,4,4
433,Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .,4,3
434,"Excuse me , may I help you ?",4,4
435,Would you please fill some gas for me ?,4,4
436,Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?,4,4
437,"Unleaded , please .",4,4
438,OK .,4,4
439,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .,4,4
440,It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .,4,4
441,What about a draft at 120 days sight ?,4,4
442,All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .,4,4
443,A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .,4,4
444,Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .,4,4
445,I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .,4,4
446,So do I .,4,4
447,"There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?",4,4
448,I haven't seen her yet .,4,4
449,I think that she is very pretty .,4,4
450,Tell me how she looks .,4,4
451,She's kind of short .,4,4
452,What height is she ?,4,4
453,She's probably about five feet .,4,4
454,"That's nice , but tell me what she looks like .",3,4
455,The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .,4,4
456,I think I might've bumped into her before .,4,4
457,Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?,4,4
458,I believe so .,4,4
459,"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?",4,4
460,"Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .",4,4
461,"You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .",4,3
462,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?,4,4
463,"San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .",4,4
464,Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .,6,6
465,"No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .",5,4
466,"Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .",4,4
467,"Do you still want the car , sir ?",4,4
468,Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .,3,3
469,It's a beautiful drive .,3,3
470,Where are the keys ?,4,4
471,"Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms .",4,4
472,Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon .,4,4
473,Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .,4,3
474,Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover .,4,4
475,"Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .",3,4
476,Sound great . Let's go !,3,3
477,Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious .,3,4
478,True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .,3,4
479,You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .,4,4
480,You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven .,3,4
481,Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .,3,4
482,Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .,4,4
483,OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant,3,4
484,Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?,4,4
485,Where do you want to go ?,4,4
486,I'm going to the hospital .,4,4
487,Get in . I'll take you .,4,4
488,About how much will it cost ?,4,4
489,It will cost you $ 10 .,4,4
490,"By the way , what's the time ?",4,4
491,"You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .",4,4
492,It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?,4,4
493,Certainly .,3,4
494,You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .,3,4
495,Where was it from ?,4,4
496,It was made in Jingdezhen .,4,4
497,Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?,6,4
498,You are right .,4,4
499,This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .,3,3
500,It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .,3,4
501,It must be most precious .,3,3
502,But it is really worth the price .,3,4
503,"Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?",4,4
504,"Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit .",4,4
505,"Oh , Would you do me a favor ?",4,4
506,Yes ?,4,4
507,Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .,4,4
508,Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?,3,4
509,"Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .",4,4
510,"Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .",3,4
511,Thanks .,3,3
512,you are welcome .,3,3
513,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",4,4
514,Alright .,4,4
515,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,4,2
516,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",4,4
517,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,0,0
518,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",4,4
519,It really hurts .,4,4
520,"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",4,4
521,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,0,0
522,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",4,4
523,To hell with you .,0,0
524,"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .",4,4
525,Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?,4,4
526,"Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .",4,4
527,It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?,4,4
528,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .,4,4
529,What about the performance itself ?,4,4
530,"Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .",4,4
531,"Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .",4,4
532,It surely is . And the cast is really the best .,4,4
533,Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?,3,3
534,"The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .",4,4
535,All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?,4,4
536,"Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .",4,4
537,"I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00",4,4
538,That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?,4,4
539,"Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .",4,4
540,What dressing would you like on the salad ?,4,4
541,"French dressing , please .",4,4
542,I beg your pardon ?,4,4
543,"Oh , French dressing .",4,4
544,"Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?",5,4
545,We still prefer French dressing .,4,4
546,Could I have some fish ?,4,4
547,Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ?,4,3
548,"Oh , spinach , I think .",4,4
549,"Fine , And what about something to drink ?",4,4
550,"Just a beer , please .",4,4
551,Good . Thank you.sir .,3,3
552,Would you like to have some more beer ?,4,4
553,"No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please .",4,3
554,Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .,3,4
555,Thank you .,3,3
556,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?",4,4
557,"Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .",4,4
558,"Yeah , that's very important .",4,4
559,"So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .",4,4
560,I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .,4,4
561,"That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .",4,4
562,It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .,4,4
563,"It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .",4,4
564,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .,4,4
565,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .",4,4
566,It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .,4,4
567,"You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .",4,4
568,I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .,4,4
569,You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .,4,4
570,It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .,4,4
571,"It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .",4,4
572,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?",4,4
573,No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .,4,4
574,It better be more than last year .,4,4
575,"Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .",4,4
576,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .",4,4
577,What a pity !,4,4
578,"If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?",4,4
579,That's OK .,4,4
580,"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?",4,4
581,Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .,4,4
582,Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?,4,4
583,It's NX567822100007 .,4,4
584,Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .,4,4
585,"OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?",4,4
586,No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .,4,4
587,May I help you ?,4,4
588,"Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?",4,4
589,Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?,4,4
590,I would prefer the first one .,4,4
591,Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .,4,4
592,"Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ?",4,4
593,"I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .",4,4
594,"OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .",4,4
595,"OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?",4,4
596,"Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .",4,4
597,"That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !",3,3
598,911 emergency . What is the problem ?,4,4
599,I would like to report a break-in .,4,4
600,When was this break-in ?,4,4
601,I believe it happened last night .,4,4
602,Where was the break-in ?,4,4
603,It happened at my house .,4,4
604,Was anything stolen ?,4,4
605,I haven't checked yet .,4,4
606,Why do you think there was a break-in ?,4,4
607,My front window was broken .,4,4
608,We'll send a squad car shortly .,4,4
609,I'd appreciate that .,3,4
610,Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ?,4,4
611,One dollar .,4,4
612,"So , I can have five for five dollars ?",4,4
613,"Actually , you can only have four .",4,4
614,"Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please .",4,4
615,Okay . Thanks .,3,4
616,House keeping.May I come in ?,4,4
617,Come in please .,4,4
618,"Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?",4,4
619,"Well , since you have come , do it now please ?",4,4
620,That's all . Have a nice stay here .,3,4
621,Thank you.Please get some soap for us .,3,4
622,Just a moment . I will do it right now .,4,4
623,"Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem .",4,4
624,Oh ? What ’ s wrong ?,4,4
625,My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late .,4,4
626,Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?,4,4
627,"Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?",4,4
628,"Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks .",3,4
629,I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?,4,4
630,"According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .",4,4
631,Then tell me something about your background .,4,4
632,"My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .",4,4
633,"Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?",4,4
634,"The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .",4,4
635,Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?,4,4
636,"Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .",4,4
637,Have you got anything to ask me ?,4,4
638,"Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?",4,4
639,"Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .",4,4
640,I see . This is my advantage .,4,4
641,Good . Have you got any other questions ?,4,4
642,No .,4,4
643,"Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .",4,4
644,"Thank you , bye-bye .",4,4
645,"Tom , is Jenny crying ?",4,4
646,Can you take he away from me ?,2,1
647,I ’ m just coming for that .,4,4
648,She kept bothering me .,4,4
649,She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ?,4,4
650,"But I am her brother , not her servant .",4,4
651,"Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?",4,4
652,Maybe you should look around for an outlet .,4,4
653,That is a wonderful idea .,3,3

1123,I think you'll really like the food there .,4,3
1124,"Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .",4,4
1125,That's OK .,4,4
1126,The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .,4,4
1127,"Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .",3,4
1128,Thank you .,3,4
1129,"Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .",4,4
1130,That's a good idea .,3,4
1131,"First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .",4,4
1132,Agreed .,4,4
1133,"For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .",4,4
1134,I understand your position .,4,4
1135,I want to buy a black suit .,4,4
1136,Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?,4,4
1137,I prefer single breasted suit .,4,4

1142,"Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .",4,4
1143,"Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price .",4,4
1144,"I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .",4,4
1145,"That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .",4,4
1146,"That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .",4,4
1147,"I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?",4,4
1148,"Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?",4,4
1149,All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .,4,4
1150,Very well . Thank you .,3,4
1151,Don't I know you ?,4,4
1152,I'm not sure.You look familiar .,4,4

1158,Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?,4,4
1159,"If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .",4,4
1160,"But if I don't pass , will you call me ?",4,4
1161,"I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .",4,4
1162,Then do I have the chance to get this job ?,4,4
1163,"I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .",4,4
1164,"I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .",4,4
1165,Your mentality is very good and that's great .,4,3

1177,What kind of people do you like to work with ?,4,4
1178,"People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .",4,4

1180,"Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department .

Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .",4,4
1190,What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?,4,4
1191,"Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .",4,4
1192,I think Yoga might be suitable for me .,4,4
1193,Why ?,4,4
1194,Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .,4,4
1195,But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .,4,4
1196,I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .,4,4

1207,"What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .",4,4
1208,"Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .",4,4
1209,And what's the cause of that ?,4,4
1210,Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .,4,4
1211,But I can't just slow down .,4,4
1212,"You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .",4,4
1213,You mean I've got to lose weight ?,4,4
1214,Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .,4,4
1215,"You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?",4,4

1217,"So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?",4,4
1218,"Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .",4,4
1219,Do you do the same exercises every day ?,4,4
1220,"No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .",4,4
1221,Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?,4,4
1222,"It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .",4,4
1223,"Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .",4,4
1224,I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?,4,4
1225,I think Pond's is the best .,4,3

1231,I will go to bed early tonight .,4,4
1232,Do you have an airsickness ?,4,4
1233,I don't know . But I have a carsickness .,4,4
1234,You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .,4,4
1235,Thank you .,4,4
1236,Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?,4,4
1237,"Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?",4,4
1238,Either way is good for me .,4,3
1239,There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?,4,4
1240,"I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .",4,4
1241,"We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .",4,4
1242,"I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .",4,4
1243,I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .,4,4
1244,I would like to see as many as possible .,4,4
1245,"When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .",4,4

1253,What do you mean ?,4,4
1254,"Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .",4,0
1255,"Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ...",4,4
1256,Enough is enough . I know .,0,4
1257,"Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ?",4,4
1258,"I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office .",4,4
1259,"Good morning , can I help you ?",4,4

1273,"Yes , sir . I ’ ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .",4,3
1274,Should we tip ? This service is pretty good .,4,3
1275,"Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ?",4,4
1276,How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars .,4,4
1277,That sounds about right .,4,3
1278,What time does the train for Tibet leave ?,4,4
1279,It will leave at 3:00 p . m .,4,4

1611,That's right . Seeing is believing .,4,4
1612,"I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .",4,4
1613,"That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .",4,4
1614,"What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .",4,4
1615,"It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .",4,4
1616,I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .,4,4
1617,"Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .",4,4
1618,That's a good idea .,3,3

1654,"Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .",4,4

1656,"Give me a break , Mr Yang .",4,0
1657,"Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?",4,4

1663,"No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .",4,4
1664,"Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .",4,4
1665,"Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?",4,4
1666,"Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .",4,4
1667,Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production,6,4
1668,"That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !",4,4
1669,"Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...",3,3

1675,"Ah , get back to you .",4,1
1676,Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?,4,4
1677,Do you need a guide ?,4,4
1678,"Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?",4,4
1679,"It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .",4,4
1680,That's reasonable .,4,4
1681,Aren't you Jim Green ?,4,4
1682,"Yes , that's right .",4,4
1683,I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .,4,4
1684,"Oh , yes . I remember .",3,4
1685,"Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?",4,4
1686,"Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .",4,4
1687,I think I can handle it by myself .,4,4
1688,I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .,4,4
1689,"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .",4,4
1690,Other company rules also need your attention .,4,4

1700,We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .,4,4

1702,It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .,4,4
1703,I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .,4,4
1704,"You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !",4,4
1705,Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ?,4,4

1713,A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?,4,4
1714,"I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .",4,4
1715,Okay . Let me think about this .,4,4
1716,"Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes .",4,4
1717,May I take your order ?,4,4
1718,Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup .,4,4
1719,And what would you like after that ?,4,4

1733,"Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .",4,4

Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .",4,4
2385,How many people are on the board of directors ?,4,4

2839,"Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .",4,4
2840,Uh-huh .,4,4
2841,"Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?",4,4
2842,Yes . I'm following you .,4,4

2855,I'll hold you to that .,4,4
2856,Sounds like a plan .,3,4
2857,I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?,4,4
2858,It's simple . You can use call transfer .,4,4
2859,Is it so simple ?,4,4
2860,"Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .",4,4
2861,It's true .,4,4
2862,"Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .",4,4
2863,That's all ?,4,4
2864,"In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .",4,4
2865,Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .,4,4
2866,Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?,4,4
2867,Then I'll see you in the afternoon .,4,4
2868,OK .,4,4
2869,"Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant .",4,4

2878,I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit,4,4
2879,Why can ’ t I have it back ?,4,4
2880,Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .,4,4
2881,You have to give it back to me .,4,4
2882,You ’ re not going to get it .,4,4

2907,Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .,4,4
2908,That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?,3,3
2909,Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .,4,4
2910,What do you use your computer for ?,4,4
2911,"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you",4,4

2932,"No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?",4,4

2941,"Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?",3,3
2942,"Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .",4,4
2943,"Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .",4,4
2944,"That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .",3,4
2945,OK . Anything else ?,4,4
2946,Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .,4,4

2951,Do you think I believe the story like that ?,4,0
2952,But it's true .,4,4
2953,How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?,4,0
2954,That's coincident 。,4,4
2955,"Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。",4,4
2956,I promise I will .,4,4
2957,You'd better .,4,4
2958,"Honey , I have something important to say .",4,4
2959,Something important ?,4,4
2960,Yes . I have just booked two tickets .,4,4
2961,Tickets ? What tickets ?,6,4

2975,Our 10th wedding anniversary ?,4,4
2976,Of course . You completely forgot it .,4,4
2977,Darling . I think you have made a mistake .,4,4

2981,"Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .",4,4
2982,Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?,4,4

2985,"No , thank you . Check , please .",4,4
2986,Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .,4,4
2987,Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .,4,4
2988,"Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .",4,4
2989,How to do it ?,4,4
2990,"Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .",4,4
2991,How long will it take to reach the buffet ?,4,4
2992,"Not long , because people rush for lunch .",4,4
2993,The line sure does move fast .,4,4
2994,Tell the man behind the counter what you want .,4,4
2995,OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it .,4,4
2996,Just point to it if you don't know the name .,4,4
2997,All right .,4,3
2998,"Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ?",4,4

3002,"Yeah , so are you planning on going ?",4,4
3003,I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .,4,4
3004,"It really does , I can't wait .",3,4
3005,What time does the party start ?,4,4
3006,It starts at 8 o'clock .,4,4
3007,"Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?",4,4
3008,"I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .",4,4
3009,"Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .",4,4
3010,"After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?",4,4
3011,The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .,4,4

3027,"Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .",4,4

3029,"Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?",4,4
3030,It was good . I brought lunch from home today .,3,3
3031,You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .,6,6
3032,"Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .",4,4
3033,"I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .",4,4
3034,"Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?",4,4
3035,You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .,4,4
3036,"Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .",4,4
3037,Seriously ?,6,6
3038,"Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .",4,4

3044,"Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !",3,3
3045,"Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .",3,3
3046,Good idea !,3,3

3060,"Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number .",4,4
3061,Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .,4,4

3064,"Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .",4,4
3065,We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?,4,4
3066,"Sure , that sounds good .",3,3
3067,Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?,3,3

3075,That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .,3,4
3076,I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .,4,4
3077,"It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !",4,4
3078,Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?,4,4
3079,Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .,4,4
3080,"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?",4,4
3081,Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?,4,4
3082,"Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .",4,4

3099,I'm afraid not .,4,4
3100,In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .,4,4
3101,What is the interest rate on your card ?,4,4
3102,The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .,4,4
3103,That's very expensive !,6,4
3104,Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .,4,4
3105,How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?,4,4
3106,You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .,4,4

3113,Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?,4,4
3114,About five times a week . What about you ?,4,4

3163,"He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .",4,4
3164,How's your father ?,4,4
3165,He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .,4,4
3166,He can spend more time with his grandchildren .,4,4
3167,"Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .",4,4
3168,"So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !",3,3
3169,How do you want to spend your old age ?,4,4
3170,"In the same way , probably .",4,4
3171,Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?,4,4
3172,"Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .",4,4
3173,But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?,4,4
3174,"Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .",4,4
3175,"It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?",4,4
3176,"Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .",4,4
3177,Why not come over to work in my company ?,4,4
3178,I need to think it over .,4,4
3179,Tell me what you need .,4,4
3180,"All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .",4,4
3181,We are approaching the top of the mountain .,4,4
3182,What a beautiful view we have here .,3,3
3183,"Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .",3,4
3184,Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?,3,3
3185,Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .,4,4
3186,what did you do last night ?,4,4
3187,I just stayed at home and watched TV .,4,4
3188,did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?,4,4
3189,"yes , it was a very evenly matched game .",4,4
3190,what were the results of the game ?,4,4
3191,it ended in a tie .,4,4
3192,what was the actual score ?,4,4
3193,it was three all .,4,4
3194,really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .,6,4
3195,"if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .",4,4
3196,what happened ?,4,4
3197,"their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .",4,4
3198,that explains it .,4,4
3199,how many more games are left this season ?,4,4
3200,that was the last game before the playoffs .,4,4
3201,when do the playoffs start ?,4,4
3202,in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?,4,4
3203,of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .,4,3
3204,"Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .",4,3
3205,"sure , that would be great .",3,3
3206,"Ok , it's a date then !",3,3
3207,how are you ?,4,4
3208,"I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .",4,4
3209,"That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ?",4,4
3210,Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?,4,4
3211,"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it .",4,4
3212,"Gave me the receipt , please .",4,4
3213,Here is my receipt .,4,4
3214,What's wrong with it ?,4,4
3215,It's too small for me to wear .,4,4
3216,Would you like another bigger one ?,4,4
3217,No thanks . I want to have a refund .,4,4
3218,"OK , here is your money .",4,4
3219,"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats .",3,3
3220,"What is your favorite color , miss ?",3,4
3221,Red .,4,4
3222,Here you are.It ' s very attractive .,3,3
3223,May I try it on ?,4,4
3224,Go ahead .,4,4
3225,Is there a mirror around here ?,4,4
3226,Right over there .,4,4
3227,Does it suit me ?,4,4
3228,"Yes , you look very nice .",3,4
3229,How much is it ?,4,4
3230,We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .,4,4
3231,That's quite reasonable .,3,3
3232,What can I help you with ?,4,4
3233,May I ask you something ?,4,4
3234,What's your question ?,4,4
3235,How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?,4,4
3236,What do you need to take it for ?,4,4
3237,I'm trying to get my license .,4,4
3238,You need six hours .,4,4
3239,Can I do all six hours in one day ?,4,4
3240,You have to do it in three days .,4,4
3241,That's all I have to do ?,4,4
3242,That's everything .,4,4
3243,"Well , that's a relief .",3,3
3244,"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .",4,4
3245,Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .,4,4
3246,"An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .",4,4
3247,"Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?",4,4
3248,I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .,4,4
3249,"Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?",5,4
3250,"Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .",4,4
3251,It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?,3,4
3252,All right . Thank you .,3,3
3253,"Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .",3,4
3254,"Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .",3,4
3255,I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .,3,4
3256,"Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .",4,4
3257,Here you are . You left the medicine here .,4,4
3258,Sorry . I was too worried .,5,4
3259,I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .,4,4
3260,"Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?",4,4
3261,"Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .",4,4
3262,I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .,4,4
3263,It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .,4,4
3264,What kind of place shall we rent ?,4,4
3265,"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .",4,4
3266,Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .,4,4
3267,"Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?",4,4
3268,"I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .",4,4
3269,"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .",3,4
3270,"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .",3,4
3271,How much do you think the rent will be ?,4,4
3272,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .,4,4
3273,I have a terrible toothache .,4,4
3274,Which tooth is it ?,4,4
3275,This one here .,4,4
3276,"Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity .",4,4
3277,Can you fill it ?,4,4
3278,I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .,4,4
3279,Then I might as well have it done now .,4,4
3280,"you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .",4,4
3281,"May I have a look at that vase , please ?",4,4
3282,Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .,3,3
3283,"Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .",4,4
3284,Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?,6,6
3285,Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?,4,4
3286,The local newspaper has ads for housing .,4,4
3287,Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?,4,4
3288,Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .,4,4
3289,What do landlords charge for rent ?,4,4
3290,"Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?",4,4
3291,"There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .",4,4
3292,You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .,4,4
3293,I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .,4,4
3294,"Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .",3,3
3295,"Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?",4,4
3296,With pleasure .,3,4
3297,I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .,3,4
3298,No problem .,3,4
3299,The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .,4,4
3300,"Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .",4,4
3301,Why is the price so high ?,4,4
3302,"It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .",4,4
3303,Model of computers aren't compatible ?,4,4
3304,Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .,4,4
3305,"Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .",4,4
3306,"But by then , the technology will be outdated .",4,4
3307,"True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .",4,4
3308,"That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .",4,4
3309,"This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .",4,4
3310,I guess you get what you pay for .,4,4
3311,What kind of permanent would you like to have ?,4,4
3312,what kinds do you have ?,4,4
3313,"Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .",4,4
3314,"Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .",4,4
3315,Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?,4,4
3316,"I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .",4,4
3317,"I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .",4,4
3318,"Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .",4,4
3319,"No , no . I've got plenty left .",4,4
3320,Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?,4,4
3321,What am I going to do about souvenirs ?,4,4
3322,"Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !",4,3
3323,"Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .",4,4
3324,"Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .",4,4
3325,Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .,4,4
3326,"I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .",4,4
3327,Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?,4,4
3328,"Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .",4,4
3329,That doesn't sound too bad .,4,4
3330,"Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .",4,4
3331,Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .,3,3
3332,You're welcome .,3,3
3333,"I'd like to order breakfast , please .",4,4
3334,"What'd you like , madam ?",4,4
3335,Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ?,4,4
3336,"No , just a few minutes .",4,4
3337,How are you ?,4,4
3338,I ’ m doing well .,4,4
3339,How may I help you ?,4,4
3340,Could you cancel a check for me ?,4,4
3341,What ’ s the problem ?,4,4
3342,I wrote the check out for way too much .,4,4
3343,How much ?,4,4
3344,I wrote the check out for $ 150 .,4,4
3345,What were you supposed to write it out for ?,4,4
3346,I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .,4,4
3347,I ’ ll just cancel it for you right now .,4,4
3348,That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver .,3,3
3349,"Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?",4,4
3350,Yes . Thank you .,3,3
3351,Would you care for a drink before you order ?,4,4
3352,A glass of Qingdao beer .,4,4
3353,"Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?",4,4
3354,Will you make some recommendation ?,4,4
3355,"I ’ m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?",4,4
3356,"Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .",4,4
3357,Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?,4,4
3358,"Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?",4,4
3359,"The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course .",4,4
3360,Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag .,4,4
3361,Is there a receipt ?,4,4
3362,Yes . I ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .,4,4
3363,What must I do next ?,4,4
3364,You must go to immigration to the departure lounge .,4,4
3365,It's time for bed .,4,4
3366,"But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?",4,4
3367,"It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .",4,4
3368,I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .,4,4
3369,Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .,4,4
3370,"Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .",4,4
3371,"You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?",4,4
3372,"Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .",4,4
3373,An excellent idea . Work now and play later .,3,3
3374,"I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .",4,4
3375,"No , now it's bedtime .",4,4
3376,"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?",4,4
3377,"Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?",4,4
3378,"Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .",4,4
3379,I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .,4,4
3380,"Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?",4,4
3381,"Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?",4,3
3382,That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?,4,4
3383,"Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .",4,4
3384,"I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .",5,5
3385,"I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .",4,4
3386,"Well , it's all new stock in the window now .",4,4
3387,"May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?",4,4
3388,"Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .",4,4
3389,"Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .",5,4
3390,"Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .",4,4
3391,"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",4,3
3392,"That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .",4,4
3393,"There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",3,3
3394,I've come to hear about your offer .,4,4
3395,"We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .",4,4
3396,I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .,4,4
3397,You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .,4,4
3398,I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .,4,4
3399,"But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .",4,4
3400,I agree that yours are of the top .,4,4
3401,"Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?",4,4
3402,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .",4,4
3403,Impossible . How about 5 % off ?,4,4
3404,Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .,4,4
3405,So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .,4,4
3406,"Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .",4,4
3407,"I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ?",4,4
3408,"People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .",4,4
3409,Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ?,4,4

3415,It will be $ 850 .,4,4
3416,Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets .,4,4
3417,No problem . How do you wish to pay for it ?,4,4
3418,Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .,4,4
3419,Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?,4,4
3420,"An aisle seat , please . I ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .",4,4
3421,No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic,4,4

3424,What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?,4,4
3425,"Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .",4,4
3426,That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?,4,4
3427,"On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .",4,4
3428,That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .,3,4
3429,Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !,3,4
3430,I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things .,4,4
3431,"Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .",4,4

3433,Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .,4,4
3434,That looks graceful on you .,3,3
3435,Thank you.But it is too bright for me .,3,3
3436,How about this brown one ?,4,4
3437,Let me try it on . I like that color .,3,4
3438,"Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .",4,4
3439,But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?,4,4
3440,"Sorry , it had been sold out .",5,5

3442,I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan .,4,4
3443,How much would you like to borrow ?,4,4
3444,A thousand dollars .,4,4
3445,Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .,4,4

3449,"When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant .",4,4
3450,My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .,3,3
3451,I wouldn't mind having one myself ...,3,4
3452,Model it for me .,4,4
3453,OK !,3,3
3454,Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !,3,3
3455,"Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?",4,4
3456,"I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?",4,4
3457,"That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .",4,4
3458,A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?,4,4
3459,"A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .",4,4

3492,"Yes , sometimes the differences are great .",4,4
3493,"Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .",4,4

4098,I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited .,3,3
4099,I ’ m voting for the next President .,4,3
4100,I ’ m sure he will be .,3,3
4101,I ’ m going to make sure and vote .,4,4
4102,Good morning . May I help you ?,4,4
4103,"Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .",4,4
4104,"One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?",4,4
4105,What's the 14 pounds for ?,4,4
4106,That's for the phone calls you made from your room .,4,4
4107,Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?,4,4
4108,"Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?",4,4
4109,Here you are .,4,4
4110,Could you sign each cheque here for me ?,4,4
4111,Sure .,4,4
4112,"Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .",4,3
4113,Thank you . Goodbye .,4,3
4114,What type of people do you work with most effectively ?,4,4
4115,"I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .",4,4
4116,What things impress you in your colleagues ?,4,4
4117,I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .,4,4
4118,What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?,4,4
4119,"The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .",4,4
4120,How do you organize and plan for major projects ?,4,4
4121,"I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .",4,4
4122,Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .,4,4
4123,"I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .",4,4
4124,How do you manage your time in a typical day ?,4,4
4125,"I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .",4,4
4126,Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .,4,4
4127,I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .,4,4
4128,"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?",4,4
4129,"Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !",4,1
4130,I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .,4,4
4131,Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .,4,1
4132,It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .,4,4
4133,I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .,4,5
4134,"You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .",4,4
4135,What did he say ?,4,4
4136,"He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .",4,4
4137,He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .,4,4
4138,Want to send out for some Chinese ?,4,4
4139,Some what ?,4,4
4140,"Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .",4,4
4141,"No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?",4,4
4142,"Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .",4,4
4143,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?,4,4
4144,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .",4,4
4145,What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .,4,4
4146,Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .,4,4
4147,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?,4,4
4148,I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .,4,4
4149,"It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .",4,4
4150,Is that true ?,4,6
4151,Definitely !,4,4
4152,"If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .",4,4
4153,"Hello sir , how may I help you ?",4,4
4154,"I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .",4,4
4155,"I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?",4,4
4156,"It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry .",5,4
4157,Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .,4,4
4158,I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?,4,4
4159,"Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .",4,4
4160,I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !,4,4
4161,"I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?",4,6
4162,"Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .",4,4
4163,"Get out of my store , you jerk !",0,0
4164,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?,4,0
4165,"I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .",4,4
4166,You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?,4,0
4167,I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .,4,4
4168,"Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .",4,4
4169,"Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .",4,4
4170,How many people are on the waiting list right now ?,4,4
4171,Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .,4,4
4172,How do you think they could be ended ?,4,4
4173,I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .,4,4
4174,"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .",4,4
4175,"It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .",4,4
4176,"Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .",4,4
4177,You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .,0,4
4178,"I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today .",4,4
4179,"I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .",0,0
4180,"You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now .",4,4
4181,What sort of job would you like to take ?,4,4
4182,I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .,4,4
4183,We need an operator now .,4,4
4184,It's just the job I've been searching for .,4,4
4185,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .,4,4
4186,I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .,4,4
4187,And it takes up all the news .,4,4
4188,The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .,4,4
4189,"It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .",4,4
4190,Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .,4,4
4191,I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .,4,4
4192,Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .,4,4
4193,"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?",4,4
4194,I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?,4,4
4195,Sure . No problem .,4,4
4196,"Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?",4,4
4197,Sure . Do you have my number ?,4,4
4198,"Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .",4,4
4199,No problem . I'll wait for your call .,4,4
4200,What are you typing there ?,4,4
4201,I'm working on my resume .,4,4
4202,Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?,6,6
4203,"Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .",4,4
4204,Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?,3,3
4205,I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .,4,4
4206,Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .,4,4
4207,Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .,4,4
4208,But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .,4,4
4209,How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?,4,4
4210,Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?,4,4
4211,Is this the one you want ?,4,4
4212,"No , the one next to it .",4,4
4213,Here you are .,4,4
4214,Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?,3,4
4215,It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?,4,4
4216,"Yes , please . How much is it ?",4,4
4217,It costs $ 200 .,4,4
4218,It looks good . OK . I'll take it .,3,3
4219,"Happy birthday , Jim !",3,3
4220,"Thank you , Lisa .",3,3
4221,Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .,3,3
4222,"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .",3,6
4223,I'm very glad to hear that .,3,3
4224,"Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .",3,4
4225,What's wrong with you ? You look pale .,4,4
4226,"I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .",4,4
4227,When did the trouble start ?,4,4
4228,I was sick most of the night .,4,4
4229,It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .,4,4
4230,Have I got a high fever ?,4,4
4231,"Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?",4,4
4232,"Yes , I have .",4,4
4233,"Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '",4,4
4234,"Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .",4,4
4235,"Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .",4,4
4236,"All right , thanks .",4,4
4237,The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .,4,4
4238,What shall I do today ?,4,4
4239,"I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .",4,4
4240,I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .,4,4
4241,"You can be sure of that , sir .",4,4
4242,Thank you .,4,4
4243,I called HP about my computer .,4,4
4244,What did they say ?,4,4
4245,They said I need a new hard drive .,4,4
4246,That's too bad . How much is a new one ?,4,4
4247,"It's not too much , only about $ 85 .",4,4
4248,Plus installation ?,4,4
4249,"No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .",4,4
4250,Really ?,6,4
4251,"Yes , it's just a couple of screws .",4,4
4252,That's nice .,3,3
4253,It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .,4,4
4254,"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .",4,4
4255,"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .",4,4
4256,Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .,4,4
4257,"Yes , Mum .",4,4
4258,Is there anything wrong ?,4,4
4259,I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .,4,4
4260,Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .,4,4
4261,I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .,4,4
4262,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .,4,4
4263,But I just want to give her some tips .,4,4
4264,"Oh , she can make her own decisions .",4,4
4265,I guess you are right .,4,4
4266,Believe me . Everything will be ok .,4,4
4267,I hope so .,4,4
4268,It's beautiful here .,3,3
4269,Yes . I feel refreshed .,3,3
4270,How long will we dock ?,4,4
4271,In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .,3,4
4272,Yes . We come at the right time .,3,4
4273,"that was a really good meal , Gordon .",3,3
4274,It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .,3,3
4275,"well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .",4,4
4276,you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .,4,4
4277,let's see how much the bill is .,4,4
4278,don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .,4,4
4279,what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .,4,4
4280,"no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .",4,4
4281,"no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .",4,4
4282,"alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .",4,4
4283,"that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .",4,4
4284,"just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?",4,4
4285,you've got a deal .,4,3
4286,great . Bye .,3,3
4287,bye .,3,3
4288,I hear you are planning to travel abroad .,4,4
4289,Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?,4,4
4290,"In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .",4,4
4291,Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .,4,4
4292,"Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .",4,4
4293,And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .,4,4
4294,This looks like a very nice house .,3,3
4295,"You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .",3,3
4296,The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !,3,3
4297,The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .,3,3
4298,This home is gorgeous on the inside !,3,3
4299,"Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .",3,4
4300,The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .,3,3
4301,Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .,3,4
4302,I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .,3,3
4303,The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next .,3,3
4304,"There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .",3,3
4305,"I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .",4,4
4306,Room service.What can I do for you ?,4,4
4307,l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .,4,4
4308,"Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?",4,4
4309,Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well .,4,4

4314,Will that be first class or economy seat ?,4,4
4315,What's the fare for a first class seat ?,4,4
4316,$ 200 .,4,4
4317,Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please .,4,4
4318,"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?",4,4
4319,"Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .",4,4
4320,"That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .",4,4
4321,And I can purchase that here ?,4,4
4322,"Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .",4,4
4323,Are there any beds vacant ?,4,4
4324,"Yes , what kind of room do you want ?",4,4
4325,"I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .",4,4
4326,"Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .",4,4
4327,"Well , that's fine .",4,4
4328,Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .,4,4
4329,That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .,4,4
4330,You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?,6,6
4331,"Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t",4,4
4332,"Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?",4,4
4333,"Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .",4,4
4334,"Well , welcome to the team .",4,4
4335,Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .,3,4
4336,"Oh , thank you .",3,4
4337,Is there anything I can do for you now ?,4,4
4338,Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .,4,4
4339,"Certainly , sir .",4,4
4340,Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?,4,4
4341,Marry Lin please .,4,4
4342,"Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .",4,4
4343,"All right , could I leave a message ?",4,4
4344,Certainly !,4,4
4345,Please ask her to call John .,4,4
4346,Excuse me . Where is the way out ?,4,4
4347,"Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .",4,4
4348,"It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?",4,4
4349,"Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?",4,4
4350,It should be the way out .,4,4
4351,OK . Let's go and see .,4,4
4352,"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .",4,4
4353,"Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .",4,5
4354,I think you should be more careful next time .,4,4
4355,"Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .",5,5
4356,"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .",0,4
4357,"Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .",4,4
4358,"No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all .",4,4
4359,Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way .,5,5
4360,"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?",4,4
4361,"Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?",3,4
4362,"Things are going well for me , Joe .",3,4

4366,What movie did you want to see ?,4,4
4367,There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .,4,4
4368,I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”,4,4
4369,Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !,3,4
4370,How's the bride-to-be ?,4,4
4371,Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .,4,5
4372,"Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !",3,3
4373,I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !,2,2
4374,Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .,4,4
4375,"You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...",4,4
4376,I will . Don't worry !,4,3
4377,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?,4,4
4378,"Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .",4,4
4379,Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .,6,6
4380,"I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .",4,4
4381,Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?,4,4
4382,Nothing .,4,4
4383,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .,4,4
4384,Promise that you won't get angry .,4,2
4385,"OK , I promise . What is it ?",4,4
4386,It's a kitty .,4,4
4387,"Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .",6,0
4388,"Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .",4,4
4389,No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .,4,0
4390,"Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .",4,4
4391,All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .,4,4
4392,"I will . Thank you , Mummy .",3,3
4393,I was wondering if you could help me with something .,4,4
4394,"Sure , anything you say .",4,3
4395,"Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .",4,4
4396,"Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .",4,3
4397,What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?,4,4
4398,You need to know the type of shoes you want .,4,4
4399,Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .,4,4
4400,"The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .",4,4
4401,Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon .,4,4
4402,Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?,4,4
4403,It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .,4,4
4404,"So , it has a history for more than a decade ?",4,4
4405,Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .,4,4
4406,"What can I do for you , Madam ?",4,4
4407,Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?,4,4
4408,"Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?",4,4
4409,"Well , everything really .",4,4
4410,"All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .",4,4
4411,Let's do something outdoors today .,3,4
4412,All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .,4,4
4413,Okay . what do you want to do ?,4,4
4414,I want to go jogging .,4,4
4415,All right . That sounds like fun .,3,3
4416,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note .,4,4
4417,"I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .",4,4
4418,"But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .",4,4
4419,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .,4,4
4420,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .,4,4
4421,"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .",4,4
4422,"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?",4,4
4423,"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .",4,4
4424,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?,4,4
4425,"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .",4,4
4426,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?,4,4
4427,"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .",3,3
4428,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?,4,4
4429,"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .",4,4
4430,"You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .",4,4
4431,"OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?",4,4
4432,"I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .",4,4
4433,"OK , will do .",4,4
4434,"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .",4,4
4435,What size do you want ?,4,4
4436,I wear size 40 .,4,4
4437,How about this one ? It's the latest design .,4,4
4438,"Oh , I like the color .",4,3
4439,May I help you ?,4,4
4440,I'm looking for a pair of shoes .,4,4
4441,What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .,4,4
4442,I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ?,3,4
4443,"Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .",3,3
4444,How much are they ?,4,4
4445,They are $ 168 .,4,4
4446,I'll take them .,3,4
4447,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?,4,4
4448,I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?,4,4
4449,"Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .",4,4
4450,"Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .",4,4
4451,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .",4,4
4452,"Ok , then we can sign up for it together .",4,4
4453,Who's it knocking at the door ?,4,4
4454,I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ?,4,4
4455,All right . I'll get it .,4,4
4456,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?,4,4
4457,"No , we don't .",4,4
4458,"How many of you , please ?",4,4
4459,"Six , including two kids .",4,4
4460,I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .,5,4
4461,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .",4,4
4462,"If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .",4,4
4463,Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?,4,4
4464,I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .,4,4
4465,Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?,4,4
4466,"Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .",4,4
4467,How will I know what the numbers mean ?,4,4
4468,You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .,4,4
4469,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?,4,4
4470,We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .,4,4
4471,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .",4,4
4472,If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .,4,4
4473,What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .,4,4
4474,I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?,4,4
4475,What's your proposal ?,4,4
4476,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .",4,4
4477,Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !,4,4
4478,What would you suggest ?,4,4
4479,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .,4,4
4480,That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .,4,4
4481,OK . We can meet halfway again .,4,4
4482,Hello .,4,4
4483,"Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?",4,4
4484,"No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?",4,4
4485,"Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?",4,4
4486,B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .,4,4
4487,"Oh , you mean Canal Street ?",4,6
4488,That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .,4,4
4489,"Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?",4,4
4490,"At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?",4,4
4491,I cannot get hold of her yet .,4,4
4492,"See you around , Carl .",4,4
4493,See you later .,4,4
4494,Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?,4,4
4495,"Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .",4,4
4496,What about your use of raw materials ?,4,4
4497,"Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .",4,4
4498,What happens if you exceed the limits ?,4,4
4499,We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .,4,4
4500,Have you got any better ?,4,4
4501,That's the best there is .,4,4
4502,"Okay , I'll take one .",4,4
4503,"That'll be $ 200 , sir .",4,4
4504,"Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?",4,4
4505,"Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?",4,4
4506,"No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .",4,3
4507,What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?,4,4
4508,"External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .",4,4
4509,What are the internal factors that influence the company ?,4,4
4510,"The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .",4,4
4511,"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .",4,4
4512,What words ? Can you tell me ?,4,4
4513,"He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .",4,4
4514,"Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .",4,4
4515,"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .",4,4
4516,"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .",4,4
4517,"It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .",4,4
4518,"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .",4,4
4519,"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .",4,4
4520,How can I help you ?,4,4
4521,"Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .",4,4
4522,Do you have an appointment ?,4,4
4523,"Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .",4,4
4524,I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?,4,4
4525,Sure .,4,4
4526,"Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?",4,4
4527,That would be very nice . Thank you .,4,4
4528,"Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared",4,4
4529,did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?,4,4
4530,"no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .",4,4
4531,"yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .",4,4
4532,they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .,4,4
4533,they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .,4,4
4534,I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .,4,4
4535,did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?,4,4
4536,"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .",4,4
4537,"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?",4,4
4538,"yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .",4,4
4539,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .,4,4
4540,people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .,4,4
4541,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .,4,4
4542,that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .,4,4
4543,thank goodness we're not rich and famous !,3,4
4544,"being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .",4,4
4545,"Next , please .",4,4
4546,Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .,4,4
4547,"Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .",4,4
4548,"Yes , I have known of it .",4,4
4549,How much do you like to exchange ?,4,4
4550,"20,000 RIB .",4,4
4551,In what denominations ?,4,4
4552,"It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .",4,4
4553,"Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .",4,4
4554,"Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .",4,4
4555,"OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .",4,4
4556,It doesn't matter .,4,4
4557,Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .,4,4
4558,Thanks a lot . Good-bye .,3,4
4559,Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?,0,4
4560,We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .,4,4
4561,I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?,4,4
4562,That would be nice . How are you getting there ?,4,4
4563,"Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .",4,4
4564,"Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...",4,4
4565,And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .,4,4
4566,Which is more expensive ?,4,4
4567,But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .,4,4
4568,"Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?",4,4
4569,I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .,4,4
4570,What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?,3,3
4571,"Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .",4,4
4572,They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like .,4,3
4573,I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .,4,4
4574,Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next .,3,3
4575,I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .,3,3
4576,I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .,4,4
4577,Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?,4,4
4578,The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .,4,4
4579,"Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?",4,4
4580,"Oh , Madam , buy what ?",4,6
4581,"A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...",4,4
4582,"Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .",5,4
4583,Isn't this the car store ?,4,4
4584,No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .,4,4
4585,"Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?",5,4
4586,No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .,4,4
4587,I'm sorry to have bothered you .,5,5
4588,No problem .,3,3
4589,How about going to the cinema tonight ?,3,4
4590,That's great . What's on tonight ?,3,4
4591,"I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .",4,4
4592,Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .,6,4
4593,Don't you think it's too bloody ?,4,4
4594,"On the contrary , very exciting .",4,3
4595,"Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day .",4,4

4652,"That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?",4,4

4703,I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .,4,4
4704,How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?,4,4
4705,That's a chick flick !,3,4
4706,What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?,4,4
4707,"First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .",4,4
4708,That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .,4,4
4709,"I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of",4,4
4710,"Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .",4,4
4711,Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?,4,4
4712,The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?,4,4
4713,Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .,4,4

4728,do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?,4,4
4729,"no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .",4,4

4731,"religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .",4,4
4732,what do you think about abortion ?,4,4
4733,"I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .",4,4
4734,do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?,4,4
4735,"I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .",4,4
4736,"why not ? It's their children , too .",4,4
4737,"that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .",4,4
4738,"that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .",4,4
4739,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .",4,4
4740,But I don't have any reading assignments .,4,4

4772,But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !,4,4
4773,Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .,4,4
4774,That would be too late .,4,4
4775,Maybe the situation is too urgent .,4,4
4776,"Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .",4,4

5036,"Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .",4,4
5037,But now you are rich .,4,4

5056,"To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .",4,4
5057,What kind of music do you prefer then ?,4,4
5058,I like pop music . Do you ?,4,4
5059,Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .,4,4
5060,I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .,4,4
5061,"How long have you been in to pop music , then ?",4,4

5142,"Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .",4,4
5143,"You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?",0,0
5144,"But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .",4,4
5145,He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .,0,5
5146,"Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .",4,4
5147,"But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !",5,5

5173,"Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?",4,4
5174,"Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .",3,4
5175,That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?,4,4
5176,"It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .",4,4
5177,I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !,4,4
5178,"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .",4,4
5179,Stay for dinner with us .,3,3
5180,"I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .",4,4

5188,"I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .",4,4
5189,"What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?",6,6
5190,"That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !",4,5
5191,"So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ?",4,6
5192,"Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .",4,5
5193,"Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me .",4,5
5194,"I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .",4,5
5195,Laura ...,4,5

5197,"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .",1,4
5198,"What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .",4,4
5199,I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .,1,4
5200,Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .,4,4
5201,You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?,4,4
5202,But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .,4,4
5203,"Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .",4,4
5204,Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .,4,4
5205,I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .,5,4
5206,Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .,4,4
5207,That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .,4,4
5208,How about a training course ?,4,4
5209,A training course ? That must be costly .,4,4
5210,But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .,4,4
5211,"OK , let's have a try .",4,4
5212,OK .,4,4
5213,Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?,4,4

5216,I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?,3,3
5217,"Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?",3,3
5218,"Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .",3,3
5219,"Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?",3,4
5220,"Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?",4,4
5221,"Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?",4,4
5222,"Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?",3,3

5230,Where are you going ?,4,4
5231,I'm going to buy a CD .,4,4
5232,Why not listen to music online ?,4,4
5233,"Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?",4,4
5234,"You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .",4,4
5235,"I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .",4,4
5236,"In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .",4,4
5237,Can you recommend some to me ?,4,4
5238,Certainly . Realplayer is a good .,4,4
5239,Can I download it ?,4,4
5240,"Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .",4,4
5241,I'll try it tonight .,4,4
5242,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .,4,4
5243,"Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .",4,4
5244,"Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?",6,4
5245,He asked me how long it took me to learn English .,4,4
5246,"But , you were born and raised in California !",4,6
5247,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .",4,4
5248,What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?,0,6
5249,"You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .",4,4
5250,"So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?",4,4
5251,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .",4,4
5252,Are you sure he really got the message ?,4,4
5253,"Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .",4,4
5254,That's hilarious ! What did he say ?,3,4
5255,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .",4,4
5256,I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .,3,4
5257,Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?,4,4
5258,"Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .",4,4
5259,I see.Did they succeed in the end ?,4,4
5260,Of course not.He drowned .,4,4
5261,What can I do for you today ?,4,4
5262,I would like to use a computer .,4,4
5263,Do you have your library card ?,4,4
5264,I sure do .,4,4

5268,Okay . Now what ?,4,4
5269,"Once a computer is available , I will let you know .",4,4
5270,How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?,4,4

5278,"yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .",4,4
5279,"ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?",4,4
5280,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?,3,4
5281,it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .,3,4
5282,what should I bring with me ?,3,4
5283,"we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .",3,4
5284,I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .,3,4
5285,do you like surfing ?,3,4
5286,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?,3,4
5287,we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !,3,3
5288,I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?,3,4
5289,"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .",3,4
5290,"ok , where and when should I meet you ?",3,4
5291,we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !,3,3
5292,I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .,4,4
5293,It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .,4,4
5294,I give up ! I simply can't learn French !,4,4

5461,It must have really hurt afterwards .,4,4
5462,"Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .",4,4
5463,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .,4,4
5464,"I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !",4,4
5465,Is there any pain now ?,4,4
5466,"No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .",4,4
5467,Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?,4,4
5468,"Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .",4,4

5513,"Hey , what's new ?",4,4
5514,Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?,4,4
5515,"Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .",3,4
5516,What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?,4,4
5517,"Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .",4,4

5531,I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .,4,4
5532,"Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .",4,4
5533,"Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .",4,4
5534,What do you think about violence in movies ?,4,4
5535,"Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .",4,4
5536,"But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?",4,4

5564,"He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?",4,4
5565,"He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .",4,4
5566,Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?,6,4
5567,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .,4,4

5571,I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !,4,2
5572,"I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .",4,4

5578,Is everything ready now ?,4,3
5579,"Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .",4,3
5580,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .,4,3
5581,"Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .",4,3
5582,"It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .",3,3
5583,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .,4,3

5595,You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?,0,0
5596,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",4,4
5597,"Oh , you men ! You're all the same .",0,0
5598,"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?",4,4
5599,Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .,4,4

5606,I am looking for an article in a newspaper .,4,4
5607,Did you check the periodicals ?,4,4
5608,I didn ’ t even bother to think of that .,4,4
5609,I ’ ll show you where to find your article .,4,4
5610,I get lost in this library .,4,4
5611,It ’ s right this way .,4,4
5612,Thanks a lot for your help .,3,3
5613,How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .,3,4
5614,Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?,4,4
5615,"No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?",3,3
5616,All right . See you tomorrow night .,3,3
5617,"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?",4,4
5618,I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .,4,4
5619,"Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .",4,4
5620,I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .,4,5
5621,Why don't you take a few days off ?,4,4
5622,I can't . I am really behind of my work .,5,5
5623,Can you speak Japanese ?,4,4
5624,"Yes , I can , but not very well .",4,4
5625,Where did you learn it ?,4,4
5626,At school . And I'm still learning it now .,4,4
5627,How long have you been learning it ?,4,4
5628,About three years .,4,4
5629,Can you speak any other languages ?,4,4
5630,I'm afraid not .,4,4
5631,"Good afternoon , Johnson .",4,4
5632,"Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?",4,4
5633,"Not bad , thanks .",3,3
5634,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !,4,1
5635,God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?,4,4
5636,"Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .",4,4
5637,They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .,4,4
5638,I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .,4,4
5639,You'd better pay more attention to your health .,4,4
5640,"I will , thanks for your concern .",4,3
5641,You're welcome .,4,3
5642,It is too bad today .,4,4
5643,What happened ?,4,4
5644,"My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .",5,4
5645,How did you find him at last ?,4,4
5646,It was the police wo helped me to do that .,4,4
5647,It must have taught you a lesson this time .,4,4
5648,I want to give our kitchen the works .,4,4
5649,Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good .,4,4
5650,No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .,4,4
5651,Why should we run after the fashion ?,4,4
5652,I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .,4,4
5653,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?,4,3
5654,I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .,3,3
5655,Then tell me what's good about it .,4,3
5656,It can't be expressed by words .,4,3
5657,What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .,4,4
5658,I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .,4,4
5659,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .",4,3
5660,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .",3,3
5661,"Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .",3,3
5662,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .",4,3
5663,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?",3,3
5664,"Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .",3,3
5665,Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .,3,4
5666,"That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .",3,3
5667,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .,3,3
5668,"Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .",3,3
5669,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?,4,4
5670,What ? Why do we have to do that ?,6,4
5671,"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .",4,4
5672,"I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",3,4
5673,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !",4,4
5674,"That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !",4,4
5675,I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?,3,4
5676,"Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .",3,3
5677,"I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .",3,4
5678,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?,3,4
5679,"I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .",3,4
5680,You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?,3,4
5681,"You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .",3,4
5682,It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .,3,3
5683,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?,4,4
5684,We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .,4,4
5685,Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .,4,4
5686,But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .,4,4
5687,How do you celebrate national day in your country ?,4,4
5688,There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .,4,4
5689,What kinds of parades are there ?,4,4
5690,"The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?",4,4
5691,We don ’ t have a national day .,4,4
5692,Really ? That ’ s unusual .,6,6
5693,"I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t .",4,4
5694,"Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .",4,4
5695,"Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ?",4,4
5696,"No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .",4,4
5697,Where do your parents live ?,4,4
5698,My father lives in Washington DC .,4,4
5699,How about your mother ?,4,4
5700,My mother died two years ago .,4,4
5701,"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?",4,4
5702,"No , he's retired .",4,4

5704,"Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .",4,4
5705,Do you have any brothers or sisters ?,4,4
5706,"Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .",4,4
5707,Do you see them a lot ?,4,4
5708,Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .,4,4
5709,"Hey , how was the show ?",4,4
5710,Not great . It's a kind of boring .,4,5
5711,Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .,6,6
5712,"Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .",4,5
5713,"What happened , John ?",4,4
5714,Nothing .,4,4
5715,Why do you look unhappy ?,4,4
5716,I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .,5,4
5717,"Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you .",4,4
5718,I hope so .,4,4
5719,You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .,4,4
5720,Really ?,6,6
5721,But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .,4,4
5722,You're right .,4,4
5723,"Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .",3,3
5724,That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .,3,3
5725,Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?,3,4
5726,"Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?",3,4
5727,No problem . See you !,3,3
5728,See you !,3,3
5729,Do you like ethnic food ?,4,4
5730,"I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .",3,3
5731,Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?,6,6
5732,I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ?,4,4
5733,I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .,4,4
5734,Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ?,4,4
5735,"As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .",4,4
5736,Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !,3,3
5737,"Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .",3,4
5738,"But not as good as your mother's , right ?",4,4
5739,"Actually , it's better ...",4,4
5740,What ? Are you kidding ?,6,6
5741,No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...,4,4
5742,"Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !",3,3
5743,"OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...",4,3
5744,How many people are there in your family ?,4,4
5745,"Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .",4,4
5746,Is your brother older or younger than you ?,4,4

5748,"Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?",4,4
5749,"I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .",4,4
5750,Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?,4,4

5752,Did you go to the concert last weekend ?,4,4

5760,Do you think they'll become reconciled ?,4,4
5761,"No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .",4,4
5762,What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .,4,4
5763,have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?,4,4
5764,sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .,4,4
5765,"as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?",4,4
5766,"to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .",4,4
5767,but you look quite proficient in using them now .,4,4
5768,"certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch",4,4
5769,"yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i",4,4
5770,anything strang about that ?,4,4
5771,"maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .",4,4
5772,"oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .",4,4
5773,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .,0,0
5774,Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .,4,4
5775,I can't forget it .,0,4
5776,You'd better cool yourself down first .,4,4
5777,"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .",4,4
5778,How many credits for each course ?,4,4
5779,"Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .",4,4

5788,But what can you do ?,4,4
5789,You can yell at them .,4,1
5790,And they will yell back at you .,4,1
5791,Yelling doesn't do any good .,4,4
5792,No . The best thing to do is just stay home .,4,4
5793,"I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .",1,4
5794,You mean you suspect him .,4,4
5795,I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling .,4,4
5796,I hope I can do something for you .,4,4
5797,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .,3,3
5798,You do ?,4,4
5799,"Yeah , those classics from the great writers .",3,4
5800,But I find Japanese ones better .,4,4

5821,But it won ’ t be on my birthday .,4,4
5822,But your health is more important . Believe me !,4,4
5823,I hate computer games .,1,1

5867,I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .,4,4
5868,What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?,4,4
5869,I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .,4,4
5870,I can't agree more .,4,4
5871,Why don't you watch where you're going ?,4,0
5872,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !,6,4
5873,There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .,4,0
5874,"Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .",0,4
5875,I think my arm is broken .,4,4
5876,"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .",4,4
5877,"Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .",4,4
5878,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .,4,4
5879,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",4,4
5880,Alright .,4,4
5881,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,4,0
5882,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",4,4
5883,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,0,0
5884,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",4,4
5885,It really hurts .,4,0
5886,"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",4,4
5887,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,0,0
5888,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",4,4
5889,To hell with you .,0,0

5893,"That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .",3,3

5899,Poor child !,4,4
5900,Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?,4,4
5901,What's your excuse this time ?,4,4
5902,Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?,4,4
5903,"Yes , twice last week .",4,4
5904,Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .,4,4
5905,I don't think so . But it could've been .,4,4
5906,Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .,4,4
5907,"I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?",4,1
5908,I'll do my best .,4,4

6055,I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .,1,1
6056,He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon .,4,4
6057,I prefer potatoes to eggplants .,4,4
6058,I feel eggplants are more nutritious .,4,4
6059,"But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .",4,4
6060,"Oh , that's how you see it .",4,4
6061,That way they look longer .,4,4

6099,I can't understand him anyway .,4,4
6100,What did he say ?,4,4
6101,He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .,4,4
6102,"It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .",3,3
6103,"Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .",4,3
6104,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is .",4,4

6159,"Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .",3,3
6160,You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?,3,3
6161,We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .,3,3

6174,"You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...",3,4
6175,I'll take home economics .,4,4

6177,"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .",4,4

6179,What do you mean ?,4,4
6180,"They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .",4,4

6196,How about your husband . Does he help much ?,4,4
6197,Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?,4,4
6198,That sucks .,4,4
6199,"If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?",4,4

6206,Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?,4,4
6207,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .",4,4
6208,"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?",4,4
6209,"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .",4,4
6210,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .,4,4
6211,"Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .",4,4
6212,You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .,4,4
6213,How do you arrange this summer vacation ?,4,4
6214,I want to travel .,4,4
6215,Where would you like to go ?,4,4
6216,The seaside .,4,3
6217,That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .,3,3

6242,Does your brother have just one son ?,4,4
6243,"No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .",4,4

6261,"No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .",4,4
6262,When was that ?,4,4
6263,Let's see ... That was about six years ago .,4,4
6264,I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?,4,4

6276,I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .,4,4
6277,we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .,4,4
6278,that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?,4,4
6279,that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .,4,4
6280,I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .,4,4
6281,"the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how .",4,4

6309,"oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?",4,4
6310,"we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec",4,4
6311,wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !,3,3
6312,tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?,4,4
6313,"perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .",4,4
6314,"no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .",4,4
6315,"we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .",4,4
6316,"great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .",4,3
6317,no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .,3,3

6349,I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?,4,4
6350,Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .,4,4
6351,What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?,4,4
6352,I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .,4,4
6353,"Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .",4,4
6354,"If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .",4,4
6355,Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .,3,4
6356,Good luck .,3,3
6357,Thanks . See ya .,3,3

6370,Is classical music your favorite ?,3,3
6371,Yes . What about you ?,3,3
6372,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .,3,4
6373,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .,3,4
6374,"Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .",3,4
6375,Did you always like pop music .,4,4
6376,"I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .",4,4
6377,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .,4,4
6378,"oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .",4,6
6379,"Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .",4,4
6380,It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .,4,4
6381,Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?,4,4
6382,Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .,4,4
6383,"Fortunately , things are changing these years .",4,4
6384,"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .",4,4
6385,"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?",4,4

6402,"Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .",4,3
6403,"Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend .",4,3
6404,"Thanks , I ’ ll ask him .",3,4
6405,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !,4,5
6406,I don't know if anything terrible has happened .,4,5
6407,I have reported it to the police .,4,4
6408,We'd better prepare for the worst .,4,4
6409,"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?",4,4
6410,"He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?",4,4
6411,I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .,4,4
6412,I can think of better things to dream about ...,4,4
6413,"Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .",4,4
6414,That's crazy .,6,4
6415,Mike ! Look at the floor !,4,6
6416,What's wrong with it ?,4,4
6417,What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !,0,4

6421,What are you looking for now ?,4,4
6422,My cigarettes .,4,4
6423,"Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .",4,4

6425,Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?,4,4
6426,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .",4,4
6427,It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .,4,4
6428,Are you Chinese by birth ?,4,4
6429,"Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .",4,4
6430,How do you like it ?,4,4
6431,I like it so far . But my English still needs work .,4,4
6432,I want to study Mandarin and public relations .,4,4
6433,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .",4,3
6434,Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .,4,3
6435,Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .,2,4
6436,Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .,4,4
6437,You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?,4,4
6438,They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .,4,4
6439,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?",3,3
6440,"Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .",4,4
6441,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?,4,4
6442,It's possible .,4,4
6443,You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .,3,3
6444,"Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !",3,6

6446,How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?,6,3
6447,Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !,3,3
6448,Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !,3,3
6449,"The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .",3,3
6450,What are we waiting for ? Let's go !,3,3
6451,Let ’ s play a game !,4,4
6452,OK ! How about Scrabble ?,4,4
6453,"No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !",4,4

6457,"Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !",4,4
6458,Your future husband !,4,4
6459,Not funny .,4,4
6460,"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .",4,4
6461,"It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .",4,4
6462,Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .,4,4
6463,"For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .",4,4
6464,That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .,4,4
6465,"Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .",4,4

6470,Thank you for lending me the book .,3,4
6471,"Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .",3,4
6472,But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .,4,4
6473,Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?,4,4
6474,I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .,4,4
6475,"Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?",4,4
6476,Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .,4,4
6477,"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?",4,4
6478,"Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .",4,4
6479,That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?,4,4

6481,Yeah . I think I can find it .,4,4
6482,You're back already . That sure was quick .,4,4
6483,That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .,4,4
6484,"Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .",4,4
6485,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .",4,3
6486,"Okay , let's go !",4,3
6487,"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?",4,4

6512,There are so many things you have to prepare for .,4,4
6513,"I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .",3,4

6529,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?",4,3
6530,Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .,3,3
6531,"Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?",4,4
6532,I prefer sea food .,4,4
6533,ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .,4,4
6534,That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .,4,4
6535,See you later .,4,4
6536,bye .,4,4
6537,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .,6,5
6538,"If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop .",4,4
6539,I did . But they said they won ’ t change them .,4,5
6540,"That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do .",4,4
6541,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?,4,4
6542,Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .,4,4
6543,Totally agree . What is your solution ?,4,4
6544,"Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .",4,4
6545,You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .,4,4
6546,It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .,4,4
6547,"But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .",4,4
6548,"I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .",4,4
6549,I am so busy today .,4,4
6550,Can I help you ?,4,3
6551,I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .,4,4
6552,I ’ ll be glad to help .,3,3
6553,Or maybe make the beds .,4,4
6554,All you have to do is ask for help .,4,3
6555,Thanks . That ’ s terrific !,3,3
6556,I ’ m ready and willing to help .,3,3
6557,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .",4,4
6558,Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?,3,3
6559,Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .,4,3
6560,Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?,3,4
6561,"I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .",4,4
6562,You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .,4,4
6563,You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .,4,4
6564,I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .,4,4
6565,Do you feel ok ?,4,4
6566,"Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .",4,4
6567,Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .,4,4
6568,Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?,4,4
6569,You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .,4,4
6570,"Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .",4,4
6571,"Zach , what's that on your arm ?",4,4
6572,"I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .",4,4
6573,It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?,4,4
6574,"Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .",4,4
6575,I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .,4,4
6576,Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?,4,4
6577,"We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .",4,4
6578,Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !,4,4
6579,I can't go to your party .,4,4
6580,That's too bad .,4,4
6581,Do you like being a doctor ?,4,4
6582,"Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .",4,4
6583,Can you tell me about it ?,4,4
6584,"You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .",4,4
6585,What can you do when this happens ?,4,4
6586,"Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .",4,4
6587,Have you eaten ?,4,4
6588,Not yet .,4,4
6589,It's too hot to read .,4,4
6590,We'd better go out for a walk .,4,4
6591,Which season do you like best ?,4,4
6592,Spring .,4,4
6593,How about summer ?,4,4
6594,I dislike it most .,1,1
6595,Why ?,4,4
6596,Because the hottest season is summer in a year .,1,4
6597,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .,4,4
6598,My son came home from three years in the navy .,4,4
6599,It was a real red letter day for you .,4,4
6600,Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .,4,4
6601,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?",6,4
6602,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?",4,3
6603,"It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .",4,6
6604,"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?",4,3
6605,I must be going .,4,4
6606,Okay . Keep in touch .,3,4
6607,"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .",4,4
6608,"I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .",5,4
6609,"I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?",4,4
6610,"Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .",4,4
6611,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .,4,0
6612,I know why we have reservations .,4,4
6613,"I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .",4,0
6614,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like .,4,4
6615,Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .,4,0
6616,"Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?",4,4
6617,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .",4,0
6618,Do you think Tom will be elected president ?,4,4
6619,"No , I think Harry will get it .",4,4
6620,Let's make a bet on who gets it .,4,4
6621,"OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .",4,4
6622,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .,4,4
6623,"Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .",4,4
6624,"You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?",4,4
6625,"To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .",4,4
6626,"But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .",4,4
6627,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?,4,4
6628,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .,4,4
6629,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !,6,6
6630,"If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .",4,4
6631,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?,6,6
6632,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .,4,4
6633,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .,4,1
6634,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .,4,1
6635,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .,4,1
6636,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !",4,1
6637,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .",4,4
6638,"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .",4,4
6639,Let's hope so .,4,4
6640,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?",4,4
6641,That's because Americans love sitcoms .,4,4
6642,Sitcoms ?,4,4
6643,"Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .",4,4
6644,"In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .",4,4
6645,I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .,4,4
6646,Are you interested in history ?,4,4
6647,"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .",4,3
6648,"I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .",4,3
6649,I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !,4,4
6650,Some people say that history repeats itself .,4,4
6651,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?",4,4
6652,"The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .",4,4
6653,I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .,4,4
6654,You're looking great .,3,3
6655,"You , too .",3,3
6656,"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .",4,4
6657,"You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .",4,4
6658,"Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .",4,4
6659,It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .,4,4
6660,Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?,4,4
6661,"Yes , they say I would get a big sum .",4,4
6662,Have you discussed it with your wife ?,4,4
6663,"Yes , she leaves it to me .",4,4
6664,As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .,4,4
6665,I have to think about it .,4,4
6666,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?,4,4
6667,"Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .",4,4
6668,Of course .,4,4
6669,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .,4,4
6670,That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics .,3,4
6671,I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?,4,4
6672,"I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .",4,4
6673,What do you think our chance are in other events .,4,4
6674,"In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events .",4,4
6675,We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .,4,4
6676,I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .,4,4
6677,You are very optimistic !,3,4
6678,"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .",4,3
6679,"I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .",4,4
6680,"Well , drop by if you can .",4,4
6681,"I will , do you want me to bring anything ?",4,4
6682,"No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .",3,3
6683,It's said that John's broken up .,4,4
6684,Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .,6,6
6685,I hear that John's leading a double wife .,4,4
6686,It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .,4,1
6687,Let's play chess .,4,4
6688,I haven't played chess for a long time .,4,4
6689,"That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .",4,4
6690,"Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .",4,4
6691,You're a very good player,3,4
6692,"Not really , but once I won a prize .",4,4
6693,So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .,4,4
6694,My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .,4,4
6695,You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?,4,4
6696,"Yeah , about .",4,4
6697,Do you know Chinese better now ?,4,4
6698,"Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .",4,4
6699,"Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .",4,4
6700,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .",4,4
6701,A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .,4,4
6702,I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .,4,4
6703,"Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .",4,4
6704,"Yes , absolutely true .",4,4
6705,"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?",4,4
6706,Harry Potter .,4,4
6707,Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?,6,4
6708,"Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .",4,4
6709,Got it .,4,4
6710,Have you ever read this book before ?,4,4
6711,"No , but my little brother likes it very much .",4,4
6712,It's really a good book . You will like it too .,3,4
6713,"I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .",3,4
6714,"Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?",3,4
6715,Jane Austen .,3,4
6716,Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .,3,4
6717,I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .,3,4
6718,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .",4,4
6719,"Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .",3,3
6720,I guess we'll see just around .,4,4
6721,"Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy .",4,4
6722,You too .,4,4
6723,"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !",4,4
6724,I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !,0,0
6725,But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !,4,4
6726,Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !,0,0
6727,What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?,4,4
6728,"Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !",0,0
6729,So he talks about you behind your back ?,4,4
6730,Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !,0,0
6731,I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .,4,4
6732,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .,4,4
6733,"My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .",4,4
6734,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",2,2
6735,What is it ? What happened ?,4,4
6736,I think someone is stalking me .,2,2
6737,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",6,6
6738,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",4,2
6739,What did you do ?,4,4
6740,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",4,2
6741,Did he leave when you left ?,4,4
6742,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,4,2
6743,What did you do ?,4,4
6744,"Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?",4,4
6745,"Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?",4,4
6746,"Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .",4,4
6747,"Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .",3,4
6748,Is it close by ?,4,4
6749,It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?,4,4
6750,"OK , I'd love the company .",3,3
6751,This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .,3,3
6752,have you ever been to Disneyworld ?,4,4
6753,"when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?",4,4
6754,"the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .",4,4
6755,that's right . Why do you ask ?,4,4
6756,"well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .",4,4
6757,when are you getting married ?,4,4
6758,some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .,4,4
6759,congratulations ! I had no idea .,3,4
6760,thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?,3,4
6761,do you like amusement parks ?,4,4
6762,"for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .",4,4
6763,"if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .",4,4
6764,even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?,4,4
6765,"even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .",4,3
6766,thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .,3,4
6767,I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !,3,3
6768,Matthew ? Hi !,4,3
6769,Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?,6,3
6770,It's got to be almost a year now .,4,3
6771,How have you been ?,4,3
6772,I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .,4,3
6773,"Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?",4,4
6774,Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .,4,4
6775,"Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?",4,3
6776,Mrs . Thou ?,4,4
6777,"Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .",4,3
6778,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !,3,3
6779,I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?,4,3
6780,Are you ready to go to the mall ?,4,4
6781,Yeah . Dig my new pants ?,3,4
6782,Copycat !,4,0
6783,What do you mean ?,4,4
6784,"You went out and bought khakis , too !",4,0
6785,No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .,4,4
6786,Whatever .,4,4
6787,Have heard of Paul ?,4,4
6788,"No , what ?",4,4
6789,He's got a promotion .,4,4
6790,You're kidding .,6,6
6791,"No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .",4,4
6792,I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years .,6,4
6793,"Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .",4,4
6794,Well.Good for him .,3,4
6795,"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?",4,4
6796,I think the supermarket is closed now .,4,4
6797,"Oh , When does it close ?",4,4
6798,It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .,4,4
6799,That's too bad .,4,4
6800,"Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .",4,4
6801,Alright . What do you want to do now ?,4,3
6802,Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .,4,3
6803,Where does she live ?,4,4
6804,She lives in San Francisco .,4,4
6805,How long has she lived there ?,4,4
6806,I think she's lived there for about 10 years .,4,4
6807,That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?,4,4
6808,San Diego .,4,4
6809,"Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?",4,4
6810,No . How about you ?,4,4
6811,Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .,4,4
6812,Who's that ?,4,4
6813,Search me .,4,4
6814,I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .,4,4
6815,What did you argue about ?,4,4
6816,He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .,4,4
6817,"Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .",4,4
6818,"Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .",4,4
6819,Did you lend him a lot of money ?,4,4
6820,"Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .",4,4
6821,"Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?",4,4
6822,"No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .",4,4
6823,"Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?",4,4
6824,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .,4,4
6825,I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .,4,4
6826,Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .,4,4

6838,I do wish I could lose weight .,4,4
6839,"Well , why don't you go on the diet ?",4,4

6857,The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .,4,4
6858,Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .,4,4
6859,Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .,4,4
6860,Can you ride a horse ?,4,4

6952,Do you enjoy work here ?,4,4
6953,"It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .",4,4
6954,Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .,4,4
6955,Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .,4,3
6956,Glad to hear that .,3,3
6957,Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .,4,3
6958,What's the second solar system ?,4,4
6959,"It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .",4,3
6960,Is this good news or bad news ?,4,4

6962,You mean with people on it ?,4,4
6963,Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?,3,3
6964,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?,0,4
6965,"Sorry , I thought you knew .",4,4
6966,But you should tell me you were in love with her .,0,4
6967,Didn't I ?,4,6
6968,You know you didn't .,0,4
6969,"Well , I am telling you now .",4,4
6970,"Yes , but you might have told me before .",0,4
6971,I didn't think you would be interested .,4,4
6972,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?,0,0
6973,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",4,4
6974,"Oh , you men ! You are all the same .",0,0
6975,How was the movie last night ?,4,4
6976,I didn't really like it .,1,1
6977,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .,4,4
6978,I found it very disappointing .,1,1
6979,"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .",4,4
6980,I wasn't happy with it .,1,1
6981,Nothing is to your satisfaction .,4,4
6982,"Honey , I ’ ll be right back !",4,4
6983,Where are you going ?,4,4
6984,I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .,4,4
6985,"Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?",6,4
6986,"Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !",4,4
6987,Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !,4,4
6988,"They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !",4,4
6989,"Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .",4,4
6990,Good afternoon !,3,3
6991,"Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?",4,3
6992,"I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?",3,3
6993,"Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?",3,3

6996,What's the weather like in your country ?,4,4
6997,Mm ... It's quite warm now .,4,4
6998,Where do you live ?,4,4
6999,In London.Where do you live ?,4,4
7000,Here.Near this school .,4,4
7001,I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !,0,4
7002,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?,4,4
7003,"That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !",0,4
7004,Have you ever written up a business plan before ?,4,4
7005,"Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?",4,4
7006,"You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .",4,4
7007,"Well , that seems easy enough .",4,4
7008,"Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .",4,4
7009,Geez . Is that all ?,4,4
7010,"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !",4,4
7011,Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !,4,4
7012,I hear that Mary got mad .,4,4
7013,So I heard .,4,4
7014,What ’ s wrong with her ?,4,4
7015,She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .,4,4
7016,"Um , what will you do this weekend ?",4,4
7017,How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .,4,3
7018,A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?,3,4
7019,No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?,4,3
7020,"Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .",4,3
7021,What ’ s on TV tonight ?,4,4
7022,"Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .",4,4
7023,Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .,4,4
7024,"Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show .",4,4
7025,No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .,4,4
7026,"Yeah , if you ’ re a girl .",4,4
7027,"Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .",4,4
7028,That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .,4,4
7029,It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .,4,4
7030,"O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too .",4,4
7031,No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game .,4,4
7032,It ’ s really terrible !,1,4
7033,What are you talking about ?,4,4
7034,Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .,4,4
7035,You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .,4,4
7036,"Sarah , what did you do today ?",4,4
7037,I went shopping .,4,4
7038,Did you buy anything ?,4,4
7039,"Yes , I bought a few things .",4,4
7040,What did you buy ?,4,4
7041,I bought this coat . Do you like it ?,4,4
7042,"Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?",3,3
7043,At the mall on 5th street .,4,4
7044,Was it expensive ?,4,4
7045,"No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .",4,4
7046,That's cheap .,4,4
7047,I know . It was a really good deal .,3,3
7048,I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .,4,4
7049,"Hi , Victor . How are you ?",4,4
7050,"Oh , I'm fine .",4,4
7051,"So , are you going to go to class tonight ?",4,4
7052,Maybe ... but I don't think so .,4,5
7053,Really ? What's the matter ?,6,6
7054,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .,4,5
7055,"Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .",4,3
7056,"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .",3,3
7057,How's John doing ?,4,4
7058,He can barely make ends meet .,4,4
7059,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .,4,4
7060,They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .,4,4
7061,"If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .",4,4
7062,"No way , if it still has 21 .",4,4
7063,What's that book you have under your arm ?,4,4
7064,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .,4,4
7065,How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .,6,4
7066,I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .,4,4
7067,Is it really worth paying for ?,4,4
7068,I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .,4,4
7069,"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .",3,4
7070,"Come on , you are left behind !",4,4
7071,"Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .",4,4
7072,You just need more exercise .,4,4
7073,"Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !",4,4
7074,I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .,4,4
7075,But running so fast is not good for people over forties .,4,4
7076,Why ?,4,4
7077,We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .,4,4
7078,But I want to burn up more calories !,4,4
7079,"In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .",4,4
7080,Really ? I will slow down then .,6,6
7081,"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?",4,4
7082,"Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?",4,4
7083,"I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .",4,4
7084,"Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .",6,4
7085,"Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .",4,4
7086,"It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .",3,3
7087,But it's really exciting .,4,3
7088,"Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .",4,4
7089,Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .,4,4
7090,Yep .,4,4
7091,I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .,4,4
7092,"Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .",4,4
7093,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .",4,4
7094,The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .,4,4
7095,"Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .",4,4
7096,"It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .",4,4
7097,Are you an art aficionado ?,4,4
7098,"Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?",4,4
7099,"I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .",3,4
7100,I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .,4,4
7101,Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .,4,4
7102,"I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you .",4,4
7103,I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .,4,4
7104,That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?,3,3
7105,Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .,4,3
7106,"What does your mother do , may I ask ?",4,4
7107,My mother works in a company as an accountant .,4,4
7108,Is she busy ?,4,4
7109,"Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .",4,4
7110,"Hello , Bessie .",4,3
7111,"Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !",3,3
7112,"My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .",6,6
7113,"I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .",3,3
7114,Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .,3,3
7115,"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you .",3,3
7116,Thank you very much .,3,3
7117,"Nice day , isn't it ?",3,3
7118,It sure is .,3,3
7119,It's a good day for a picnic .,3,3
7120,"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?",4,4
7121,I don't want to .,4,0
7122,"Well , come over and talk to me then .",4,4
7123,Certainly not .,0,0
7124,May I turn on the TV then ?,4,4
7125,Turn on the TV for what ?,4,0
7126,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .,4,4
7127,"Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?",4,0
7128,"I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .",4,4
7129,"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .",1,1
7130,Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !,6,6
7131,Brian ! How have you been ?,4,3
7132,"Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !",3,3
7133,"Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .",3,3
7134,"Well , you look great ! How are you ?",3,3
7135,I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .,3,3

7210,"Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .",4,4

7212,"Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .",5,4

7248,How do you research your books ?,4,3

7277,"Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .",1,4
7278,"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .",4,4
7279,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?,4,4
7280,"You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !",0,4
7281,"Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?",4,4
7282,"Yeah , absolutely !",4,4
7283,"And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .",4,4
7284,"You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?",4,4
7285,What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy .,4,4

7291,"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .",3,3
7292,"Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .",4,3
7293,And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .,3,3
7294,"Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .",3,4
7295,There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .,3,4
7296,"That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .",3,4
7297,"Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .",3,4
7298,"My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .",4,4
7299,"OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .",4,4
7300,"Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .",4,4

7302,The boy is good for nothing .,4,4
7303,"As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him .",4,4
7304,He is hopeless .,4,4

7309,"Great , so what happens now ?",3,4
7310,"Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .",3,3
7311,Do you believe in UFOs ?,4,4
7312,"Of course , they are out there .",4,4
7313,But I never saw them .,4,4
7314,"Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .",4,4
7315,You mean that you can them .,4,4
7316,That's right . I can see them in my dreams .,4,4
7317,They come to the earth ?,4,4
7318,No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .,4,4
7319,Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?,4,4
7320,"OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .",4,4

7465,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !",3,3
7466,"Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?",3,3
7467,"Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .",4,3
7468,Can't Elvin handle it ?,4,4
7469,I think he's got too much on his plate .,4,4
7470,This is the best dinner I've ever had .,3,3
7471,How about the soup ?,3,3
7472,I've never tasted anything better .,3,3
7473,How nice of you to say so .,3,3
7474,"Hey Nick , what are you up to ?",4,4
7475,"Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?",4,4
7476,Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man .,6,4
7477,"Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .",3,4
7478,Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !,3,3
7479,"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !",4,4
7480,"Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !",3,4
7481,"The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?",4,4
7482,Let ’ s do it !,3,4
7483,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .",4,4
7484,I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .,4,4
7485,Where were you ?,4,4
7486,I was in New York for a wedding .,4,4
7487,Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?,4,4
7488,Don't feel like it . I'm broke .,4,4
7489,"Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?",4,4
7490,"Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .",4,4
7491,I'll go myself then .,4,4
7492,"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .",4,4
7493,I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .,4,5
7494,"come on , nothing can be that bad .",4,4
7495,"but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .",4,4
7496,"ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?",4,4
7497,I've fallen in love with my boss .,4,4
7498,really ? Is he married ?,6,6
7499,"no , of course not . He is still single .",4,4
7500,then what's your problem ?,4,4
7501,I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .,4,5
7502,"oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .",4,4
7503,"worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .",4,5
7504,office romance is very tricky .,4,4
7505,it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .,5,5
7506,"cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .",4,4
7507,You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?,4,4
7508,"Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .",4,4
7509,With the job ?,4,4
7510,"With everything , with everybody , with all this !",0,4
7511,A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .,4,4
7512,"It wasn't always like this , you know .",4,4
7513,What do you mean ?,4,4
7514,"Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .",4,4
7515,You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .,4,4
7516,"Certainly , perhaps .",4,4
7517,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .",4,0
7518,"Hey , Isabelle ...",4,4
7519,Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .,6,0
7520,"Yes , I am the guy .",4,4
7521,What a bummer ! You set me up ?,4,0
7522,Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...,4,4
7523,How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ),0,0
7524,"Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !",4,4
7525,Why did you lie to me in the email ?,4,0
7526,I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .,4,4
7527,I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .,4,0
7528,"I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .",4,4
7529,"Peter , how often do you exercise ?",4,4
7530,"Well , I swim and run every day .",4,4
7531,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ?",4,4
7532,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .",4,4
7533,Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?,4,4
7534,"Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .",4,3
7535,What do you drink ?,4,4
7536,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .",4,4
7537,What do you drink ?,4,4
7538,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?,4,4
7539,Yeah .,4,4
7540,Who won ?,4,4
7541,China .,4,4
7542,What was the score ?,4,4
7543,China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .,4,4
7544,Wonderful !,3,3
7545,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .",4,4
7546,I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .,4,4
7547,"Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .",4,4
7548,"I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .",4,4
7549,"It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .",4,4
7550,"Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !",4,4
7551,Isn't it wonderful walking here ?,3,3
7552,What do you mean ?,3,4
7553,I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .,3,3
7554,"Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .",3,3
7555,It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?,3,4
7556,"You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .",3,4
7557,What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?,3,4
7558,Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .,3,4
7559,What's there after that ?,3,4
7560,"Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .",3,4
7561,What are they all for ?,3,4
7562,"Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .",3,4
7563,"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?",4,4
7564,I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .,4,4
7565,What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?,4,4
7566,Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .,4,4
7567,And your parents took it badly ?,4,4
7568,That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .,4,4
7569,"Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?",4,4
7570,"She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .",4,4
7571,How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?,4,4
7572,Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .,4,4
7573,Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .,6,6
7574,What do you mean ?,4,4
7575,"Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .",4,4
7576,"I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .",4,4
7577,Do you think they two will get married ?,4,3
7578,"Yeah , you can count on it .",4,3
7579,"I think so . Yes , they get along so well .",4,3
7580,I like him . He's good for her .,3,3
7581,You're right . He sure is .,3,3
7582,What do you think of Frank ?,4,4
7583,He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .,4,4
7584,Why do you say that ?,4,4
7585,"Whatever things get tough , he gives in .",4,4
7586,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .,4,4
7587,Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .,4,4
7588,I sure hope so .,4,4
7589,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?",4,4
7590,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .",4,4
7591,I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?,4,4
7592,Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .,4,4
7593,It must be interesting to study English .,4,4
7594,Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .,3,3
7595,Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?,4,4
7596,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .,4,4
7597,It's quiet everywhere in winter .,4,4
7598,Yes . I like winter .,3,4
7599,Me too .,3,4
7600,It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?,3,3
7601,That's a good idea . Let's go !,3,3
7602,What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .,6,3
7603,Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .,3,3
7604,I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .,3,3
7605,Yes . Very wonderful .,3,3
7606,There is a snowman over there .,3,3
7607,How lovely it is !,3,3
7608,Tim's always bothering me .,4,4
7609,Just tell him off .,4,4
7610,Who are those guys ?,4,4
7611,"Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players .",4,4
7612,Oh .,4,4
7613,"Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !",4,6
7614,All right !,4,6
7615,"Here comes Jordan , though .",4,3
7616,"Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .",4,3
7617,"Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .",4,3
7618,Which team do you think will win ?,4,3
7619,The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .,4,3
7620,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .",4,4
7621,It's ok . What do you want to ask ?,4,4
7622,Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?,4,4
7623,The first place you should go is the International Center .,4,4
7624,Why ?,4,4
7625,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .,4,4
7626,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?,4,4
7627,"They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .",4,4
7628,Can we get any more help at the International Center ?,4,4
7629,"Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .",4,4
7630,I see . It must be worth going to .,4,4
7631,"Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .",4,4
7632,Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .,3,3
7633,"It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .",4,3
7634,"hi , Lander . What's wrong ?",4,4
7635,I can hardly make ends meet these days .,4,4
7636,same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .,4,4
7637,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .,4,4
7638,true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .,4,4
7639,definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .,4,4
7640,"the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .",4,4
7641,is that inflation ?,4,4
7642,"inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .",4,4
7643,has the government taken some measures to curb it ?,4,4
7644,yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .,4,4
7645,but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .,4,4
7646,you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .,4,4
7647,how ?,4,4
7648,"for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .",4,4
7649,sounds a good idea .,3,3
7650,"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .",4,4
7651,You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .,4,4
7652,Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .,4,4
7653,You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .,4,4
7654,"The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !",4,3
7655,"Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .",4,4
7656,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?,4,4
7657,"Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .",4,4
7658,What ?,4,4
7659,"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...",4,4
7660,What is it ?,4,4
7661,Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .,4,4
7662,That makes you feel uncomfortable ?,4,4
7663,Yeah . we never do that in a public office .,4,4
7664,Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .,4,4
7665,"I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .",4,4
7666,"Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .",4,4
7667,Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?,4,6
7668,Yeah .,4,4
7669,"Oh , I'm shocked .",6,6
7670,What courses did you take in college ?,4,4
7671,"I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .",4,4
7672,Which course did you like best ?,4,4
7673,I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .,4,3
7674,Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?,4,4
7675,Certainly . What's the matter ?,4,4
7676,I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .,4,4
7677,Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .,4,4
7678,Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?,3,4
7679,"That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .",4,4
7680,Is the service charged ?,4,4
7681,No . it's free .,4,4
7682,Really . I'll get a computer at once .,6,4
7683,We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?,4,3
7684,It ’ s so cool !,3,3
7685,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ?",4,4
7686,I ’ m afraid this seat is taken .,4,4
7687,Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .,4,4
7688,You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?,4,4
7689,Thank you .,3,4
7690,I prefer potatoes to eggplants .,4,4
7691,I feel eggplants are more nutritious .,4,4
7692,"But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .",4,4
7693,"Oh , that's how you see it .",4,4
7694,Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?,4,4
7695,"Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .",4,4
7696,It's a deal .,4,4
7697,Where do you plan to go this winter ?,4,4
7698,"Alps , suppose .",4,4
7699,"Oh , yes , you like skiing .",3,4
7700,Right .,4,4
7701,"Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .",4,4
7702,You were showing respect and admiration for them .,4,4
7703,I wish I were a hero .,4,4
7704,"Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?",4,4
7705,Is he really ?,6,6
7706,"Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .",4,4
7707,Who is he marring ?,4,4
7708,"A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .",4,4
7709,Have they set a date for the wedding ?,4,4
7710,Not yet .,4,4
7711,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class .",4,4
7712,"Does the class start again , Mam ?",4,4
7713,"Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .",4,4
7714,"Oh , breaktime flies .",4,5
7715,"Come on , baby . It ’ s time now .",4,4
7716,"Mam , another minute , could I ?",4,4
7717,"Hurry up , little boy .",4,4
7718,Do you have any hobbies ?,4,4
7719,"Yes , I like collecting things .",4,3
7720,"Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?",3,3
7721,"Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on .",3,4
7722,Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?,6,6
7723,"Yes , stones .",4,4
7724,"well , I can ’ t just imagine it .",4,4
7725,"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?",4,4
7726,Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .,4,4
7727,"Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .",4,4
7728,What a nice day !,3,3
7729,yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?,3,4
7730,"great , let's go !",3,3
7731,"hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .",4,3
7732,"exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...",3,3
7733,"yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !",4,4
7734,"why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .",3,4
7735,are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?,4,6
7736,"never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?",4,4
7737,"yeah , I think so .",4,4
7738,ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .,3,3
7739,wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .,3,3
